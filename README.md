I have failed miserably at this assignment.
I got stuck and wasted a lot of time on many things. Most notibly the timer for some reason and the big time killer was trying to get the questions and choices to load, which I could not.
I seem to go down a Google rabbit hole when I'm stuck, think I find a better way, re-do my work, then realize that I can't get that to work either and I start back at the beginning.
